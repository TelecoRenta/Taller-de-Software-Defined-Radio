# Taller-de-Software-Defined-Radio

Workshop version A title: ***Sincronización: elemento clave en las comunicaciones móviles***

Workshop version B title: ***Introducción a las comunicaciones móviles con SDR - Software Defined Radio***

This workshop is delivered in two versions, namely version A, which is based entirely in software resources and version B, which in addition of software it also requires a set of hardware devices. Version A is indeed simpler to execute but somehow reduced in scope in respect to version B, whereas version B requires to invest in acquiring the hardware or, alternatively, doing the workshop at the premises of the [CTTC](https://www.cttc.cat/).

The main objective of this workshop is to introduce students to the technology of Software Defined Radio and more specifically into a critical aspect of any radio communication system such is synchronization. To do this, we propose a series of basic exercises that will allow you to practice with the frequency synchronization of frequency multiplexed systems (OFDM).

The workshop is supported by three types of files: 
1. **PDF guides** that consist in one guide for the instructor and another guide for the student
2. **Matlab scripts**  to analyse signals at different points of the radio link either in the time domain or in the frequency domain
3. ***Data files***, which are prerecorded files to be analised by means of the Matlab scripts in case that version A is selected

## Procedure


To get access to Version A resources go to [version A](https://gitlab.cttc.es/mnavarro/telecorenta-taller/-/tree/main/1A?ref_type=heads)

To get access to Version B resources go to [version B](https://gitlab.cttc.es/mnavarro/telecorenta-taller/-/tree/main/1B?ref_type=heads)

## About


This workshop has been created by Dr. Adrián Agustín and Dr. Mónica Navarro at the [Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC)](https://www.cttc.cat/), in the frame of the TelecoRenta Proyect from the UNICO 5G Program.
